**Are you seeking greater prosperity, happiness, or longevity? Ready to build, learn, and thrive with others like you?**

Welcome! I’m Joshua Seymour.

I started these projects to empower individuals and communities to flourish—combining my passion for innovation, decentralized systems, and human potential. I architect and steward digital-physical communities designed to unlock human flourishing—through positive-sum, regenerative, and network state principles. My focus is on building and evolving [Neothink DAO](https://github.com/neothink-dao/neothink.io) (intrapreneurship, established communities) and [Avolve DAO](https://github.com/avolve-dao/avolve.io) (entrepreneurship, new and launching), each with a clear mission, founder, and path to progressive decentralization.

I thrive in global, collaborative environments—online and offline—and am always open to connecting, co-creating, and relocating for the right opportunities and teams.

## Frequently Asked Questions & Common Objections

**What is a “network state” and why should I care?**  
A network state is a digitally native community with a shared vision, real-world impact, and a path to self-governance. By joining early, you help shape the rules, culture, and benefits of a new society—while earning rewards and building meaningful relationships.

**Is this just another crypto project or online community?**  
No. While we intend to use web3 and blockchain for transparency and coordination later this year, our current focus is on real transformation: personal, collective, and ecosystem-wide. Our DAOs are built around positive-sum values, not speculation.

**Do I need to be a developer or blockchain expert to join?**  
Not at all! Anyone can join as a Subscriber, Participant, or Contributor. We welcome learners, builders, creators, and supporters from all backgrounds.

**How do I actually get started?**  
Pick a path (Neothink DAO or Avolve DAO), join as a User or Admin, and follow the onboarding steps. Each site/app is its own social and communication platform—so you’ll connect, share, and participate directly within the ecosystem.

**What if I just want to observe or learn before committing?**  
That’s fine! You can explore the public areas of each platform, read resources, and observe community activity before diving deeper.

**What’s the business model? How are projects funded?**  
We use a mix of subscriptions, token rewards, and venture partnerships. Admins (builders, partners, associates) help shape and fund new projects, while Users enjoy access and community benefits.

**How do you avoid the pitfalls of other DAOs or online movements?**  
We focus on real-world value, progressive decentralization, and a clear governance roadmap. Our founders are public, our vision is long-term, and we prioritize collaboration over hype.

**How can I trust this isn’t a scam or rug pull?**  
Transparency is key: our founders are public, our code and governance are open, and our incentives are aligned for long-term growth and positive impact.

**What if I have more questions?**  
Reach out directly, join a call, or connect with us within the platforms. We’re here to help!
