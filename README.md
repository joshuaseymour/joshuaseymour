Welcome! I‚Äôm Joshua Seymour.

I architect and steward digital-physical communities designed to unlock human flourishing‚Äîthrough positive-sum, regenerative, and network state principles. My focus is on building and evolving [Neothink DAO](https://github.com/neothink-dao/neothink.io) (intrapreneurship) and [Avolve DAO](https://github.com/avolve-dao/avolve.io) (entrepreneurship), each with a clear mission, founder, and path to progressive decentralization.

I thrive in global, collaborative environments‚Äîonline and offline‚Äîand am always open to connecting, co-creating, and relocating for the right opportunities and teams.

- **Technical curiosity:** Experimenting with new models for coordination, learning, and value creation.
- **Philosophy:** Global meritocracy, open web values, and the power of decentralized, internet-native communities.
- **Vision:** Passionate about the ‚Äústartup society‚Äù and network state journey, especially as it relates to solarpunk, regenerative futures.

Neothink DAO and Avolve DAO have already attracted early users and contributors. I‚Äôm always interested in new collaborators, partners, and aligned communities.

## Governance & Network State Vision

Both Neothink DAO and Avolve DAO are parallel startup societies, intentionally structured to mature into true network states‚Äîeach with a clear founder, a strong sense of mission, and a path toward progressive decentralization and self-governance.

> ‚ÄúA network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.‚Äù

**Founders & Governance Structure:**
- **Neothink DAO:**  
  - The recognized founder of Ascenders, Neothinkers, and Immortals (and their related values) is Mark Hamilton, his family, and their core supporters.
  - The Neothink+ monorepo is owned and controlled by Neothink DAO, with Mark Hamilton (along with his family and team) as the benevolent dictator and philosopher king, stewarding the project until these parallel societies mature to fully govern themselves.

- **Avolve DAO:**  
  - The recognized founder of Avolve and its super-projects is Joshua Seymour.
  - The Avolve repo is owned and controlled by Avolve DAO, with Joshua Seymour (along with his family and team) as the benevolent dictator and philosopher king, guiding the project until it matures into full self-governance.

**Stewardship Philosophy:**  
Both DAOs are committed to progressive decentralization. The ‚Äúbenevolent dictator‚Äù model is a temporary measure to ensure strong leadership, clear vision, and principled growth‚Äîuntil the communities are ready for fully decentralized, self-sustaining governance.

**Network State Trajectory:**  
Each society is intentionally structured to:
- Start as a focused, values-driven startup society
- Grow into a network union (digital community with collective action)
- Expand into a network archipelago (crowdfunded physical presence)
- Ultimately achieve the scale, legitimacy, and diplomatic recognition of a true network state

## üåå Avolve DAO (Entrepreneurship)

Avolve DAO is a platform for positive-sum transformation‚Äîhelping individuals, collectives, and the ecosystem evolve from ‚ÄúDegen‚Äù (zero-sum, extractive) to ‚ÄúRegen‚Äù (positive-sum, regenerative).

**Three Core Values:**
- **Superachiever:** The individual journey of transformation (SAP token)
- **Superachievers:** The collective journey of co-creation (SCQ token)
- **Supercivilization:** The ecosystem journey for regenerative progress (GEN token)

**Storyline:**  
Most people are ‚ÄúDegens,‚Äù stuck in a zero-sum, follow-the-leader mentality that enables the Anticivilization. Avolve DAO empowers ‚ÄúRegens‚Äù‚Äîself-leaders, value creators, and integrated thinkers‚Äîto build a Supercivilization through personal and collective transformation.

**Game Loop:**  
- Create your Personal & Business Success Puzzle (SAP, PSP, BSP)
- Unlock Supermind Superpowers (SMS)
- Co-create the Superpuzzle (SPD, SHE, SSA, SGB)
- Accelerate the transition from Degen to Regen‚Äîfor yourself and for the world

## Frequently Asked Questions & Common Objections

**What is a ‚Äúnetwork state‚Äù and why should I care?**  
A network state is a digitally native community with a shared vision, real-world impact, and a path to self-governance. By joining early, you help shape the rules, culture, and benefits of a new society‚Äîwhile earning rewards and building meaningful relationships.

We use a mix of subscriptions, token rewards, and venture partnerships. Admins (builders, partners, associates) help shape and fund new projects, while Users enjoy access and community benefits.

**How do you avoid the pitfalls of other DAOs or online movements?**  
We focus on real-world value, progressive decentralization, and a clear governance roadmap. Our founders are public, our vision is long-term, and we prioritize collaboration over hype.
