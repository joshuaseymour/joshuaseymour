# Joshua Seymour — Building Positive-Sum Worlds

Welcome! I’m Joshua Seymour, a builder of networked communities, transformative platforms, and positive-sum ecosystems. My work spans both intrapreneurship (Neothink DAO) and entrepreneurship (Avolve DAO), unified by a mission: to empower individuals and collectives to prosper, grow, and co-create a better future.

## 🌐 Ecosystem Overview

### Neothink+ Hub (`go.neothink.io`)

The Neothink+ Hub is open to all who wish to:
- Grow as an **Ascender** (LIVE: prosperity & value creation)
- Expand as a **Neothinker** (LOVE: happiness & integrated thinking)
- Thrive as an **Immortal** (LIFE: longevity & self-leadership)

You can choose any one, any combination, or all three—based on your own interests and goals.  
**You do not need to be a Superachiever to enjoy the Neothink+ Hub.**  
If you choose to embody all three, you are recognized as a **Superachiever**, which unlocks special status and access to Avolve.

### Avolve DAO

**Avolve** is both a bridge and a stand-alone platform for Superachievers—those who are ready to create their personal “success puzzle” and co-create our collective “superpuzzle.”  
- If you’re a Superachiever in Neothink+ (all three roles), you can access Avolve as a bonus.
- But Avolve also welcomes all true, real, and pure Superachievers—regardless of their journey through Neothink+.

#### The Avolve Mission

Avolve exists to help individuals, collectives, and the entire ecosystem “Avolve” from surviving/striving as Degens (degenerative, zero-sum, value-destroying) to thriving as Regens (regenerative, positive-sum, value-creating and value-producing).

- **Superachiever:** Personal transformation (SAP token)
- **Superachievers:** Collective transformation (SCQ token)
- **Supercivilization:** Ecosystem transformation (GEN token)

---

## 🏆 Gamification & Tokenomics

- **Positive-sum, transparent, and metrics-driven.**
- Every action, contribution, and collaboration is rewarded through tokens (GEN, SAP, SCQ, and more).
- Daily/weekly quests, feature unlocks, and governance for active participants.

---

## 🚀 Who Can Participate?

**Users:**  
- Subscribers, participants, and contributors—anyone seeking personal or collective growth.

**Admins:**  
- Venture Builders (building the ecosystem)
- Venture Partners (funding and supporting)
- Venture Associates (helping and facilitating)

Everyone is welcome—whether you’re here to learn, build, fund, or help!

## 💡 The Storyline: Degen to Regen

Civilization is shaped by mentality.  
- Most are “Degens” (followers), sustaining the Anticivilization—a zero-sum game run by value destroyers.
- Some are “Regens” (self-leaders, value creators), building the Supercivilization—a positive-sum game for all.

**Avolve’s mission:** Help users evolve from Degen to Regen, accelerating both personal lifestyle and collective standard of living.

---

## 🤝 Community & Contribution

- **Open source:** Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are welcome!
- **Onboarding:** Clear guides, FAQs, and support for every step.
- **Weekly Zooms:** Join our regular meetings for luck (Sunday), prosperity (Monday), happiness (Wednesday), and longevity (Friday).
- **DAO governance:** Transparent, participatory decision-making.
