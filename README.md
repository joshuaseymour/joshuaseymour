## 🚀 Neothink DAO: The Network of Transformation

**Neothink DAO** powers four distinct, next-generation platforms—each designed for people already on their journey of growth, seeking to go further, faster, forever:

- **Ascenders** — For those building wealth and business mastery.
- **Neothinkers** — For those deepening happiness, knowledge, and fulfillment.
- **Immortals** — For those maximizing health, longevity, and self-leadership.
- **Neothink+ Hub** — The unifying gateway for all, at [go.neothink.io](https://go.neothink.io).

**Each app is a standalone experience, but together they form a network state for those who want more—wealth, happiness, health, and luck—at an accelerated pace.**

## 🌌 Avolve DAO: The Superachiever’s Playground

**Avolve** is a separate but interoperable ecosystem—built for the world’s emerging and established Superachievers.

- **Avolve** stands on its own: a platform for those who want to create their personal “success puzzle” and co-create our collective “superpuzzle.”
- **Open to all Superachievers**—whether you come through Neothink+ or arrive from elsewhere.

### Value Proposition

- **For Superachievers:**  
  - Accelerate your journey from “Degen” (zero-sum) to “Regen” (positive-sum).
  - Unlock advanced tools, governance, and co-creation opportunities.
  - Participate in a regenerative, metrics-driven, tokenized economy.

### Business Model

- **Subscription:** Direct access to advanced features and communities.
- **Tokenomics:** Earn, spend, and stake tokens (GEN, SAP, SCQ, and more) for influence, rewards, and marketplace access.
- **Premium Offerings:** Workshops, masterminds, and exclusive content.
- **DAO Treasury:** Revenue is distributed to contributors, builders, and the community via transparent governance.
